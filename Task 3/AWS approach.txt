Here are the steps I would take to identify the AWS instance that has the lowest latency with the server where the exchange's matching engine resides:

1. Determine the physical location of the exchange's matching engine.

2. Identify the AWS regions or availability zones closest to the exchange's matching engine.

3. Deploy an identical AWS instance in each of the identified regions or availability zones.

4. Measure the latency between each AWS instance and the exchange's matching engine using network monitoring tools.

5. Analyze the results and select the AWS instance with the lowest latency.

6. Use the selected AWS instance to deploy the order book stream for the best possible connection to the exchange's matching engine.

By following these steps, I can ensure that I identify the AWS instance with the lowest latency and deploy my order book stream with the best possible connection to the exchange's matching engine.
